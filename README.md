This a Chat Bot created specifically for the therapy. 

To run this first clone the repo and install all the requirements which are include in the requirmnets.txt.

Create an OpenAPI account and get and api where you must add in the python code i.e, in the .py file.
I did'nt include any option for ipynb file it is just for understanding. 
After running the .py file you will get a 'https' link which you can copy in the browser and get the chatbot running.
